\section{Discovery: Linking Solar System Objects}

Discovering, rather than simply detecting, small objects throughout
the Solar System requires unambiguously linking a series of detections
together into an orbit. The orbit provides the information necessary
to scientifically characterize the object itself and to understand the
population as a whole. Without orbits, the detections of Solar System
Objects (SSOs) by LSST will be of limited use; objects discovered with
other facilities could be followed up by LSST, but almost the entire
science benefit to planetary astronomy would be lost. Linking and
orbit determination for Solar System objects is similar to source
association for non-moving objects; it provides the means to identify
multiple detections as coming from a single object.

Therefore, the first concern regarding the Solar System is related
to the question ``Can we accurately link individual detections of moving objects into
orbits?''.  This requirement poses varying levels of difficulty as we
move from Near Earth Objects (NEOs) through the Main Belt Asteroids
(MBAs) and to Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Scattered Disk Objects
(SDOs), as well as for comets and for other unusual but very
interesting populations such as Earth minimoons. Due to their small
heliocentric and geocentric distances, NEOs appear move with
relatively high velocities and are distributed over a large fraction
of the sky, far from the ecliptic plane. MBAs are densely distributed,
primarily within about 30 degrees of the ecliptic. TNOs and SDOs move
slowly, however short time intervals between repeat visits in each night may make these difficult
to link. Comets and Earth mini-moons may require more complicated
orbit fitting to allow for non-gravitational or geocentric
orbits. It also implies that we do not create false objects by
incorrectly linking detections and/or noise.

Much of the answer to this question comes down to the performance of
various pieces of LSST Data Management software. In particular,
important questions are the
rate of false positive detections resulting from difference imaging, the compute
limitations of the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) to extend to high
apparent velocities, and the capability to unambiguously determine if
a linkage is `real' or not via orbit determination (done as part of
MOPS). Thus this question ranges beyond the limits of the OpSim simulated
surveys, but bears on the observing strategy requirements for
discovering Solar System Objects. An in-depth study of the performance
of difference imaging and MOPS is currently ongoing. However, we can
make a range of assumptions on how MOPS will perform and evaluate how
many and which objects can be linked under observational cadence, given those assumptions.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

The criteria for `discovery' with MOPS depends on the number
of observations of an object acquired per night, within some time
window (creating `tracklets'), repeated over a number of nights within window of some
days (creating `tracks'), linked into an orbit with a threshold on
astrometric residuals. The current assumptions are that we can link
detections into orbits with 2 detections per night within 90 minutes,
repeated for 3 nights within 15 days. The additional assumptions are
that with these 6 observations, we will be able to create low-accuracy orbits that will suffice to link
additional observations obtained at later (or earlier, in the LSST
archive) times, and that that the orbit fitting will enable rejection
of mislinkages.

We can also set other requirements for discovery. Requiring 4
detections within 90 minutes is a fairly common discovery criteria for
NEO surveys, as it reduces the number of mislinked tracklets to almost
zero. We could also require 4 nights of pairs, in order to improve the
initial orbit fitting and mislinkage rejection.

With these discovery criteria, we can then evaluate the completeness
of an LSST simulated survey, for a given population. We can look at
this as a function of H magnitude and as a function of orbital
parameters.

For PHAs and NEOs there are special considerations in terms of
completion that arise from planetary defense concerns. For most other
populations, the general desire is simply to have a high level of
completeness, with no gaps in completeness that depend strongly on
orbital parameters. In particular, the desire is to be able to
calibrate any selection effects in discovery so that the survey completeness can
be used to debias the underlying population models.

Discovery opportunity, and thus the completeness of the underlying
population, is very sensitive to the time interval between
observations. For most solar system objects, with a 90 minute window
within a night, gathering two or more repeat observations within a night requires
that the field pointing is revisited two or more times. Especially if the time
interval is much longer than 30 minutes, ensuring that the sky
observed within a night covers large contiguous blocks (rather than
narrow disconnected strips), also becomes important to be sure that
objects are followed between pointings.  Gathering
observations over multiple nights for a wide variety of Solar System
objects (moving at a wide variety of apparent velocities) will require covering a large
neighboring area of sky; thus the internight revisit rate for large contiguous
blocks of sky is important. An optimal discovery strategy for moving
objects could be ensuring a minimum (default: two) number of revisits
within a night within a short time window (default: 90 minutes),
preferably over a large block of sky, and
covering large contiguous amounts of sky several (default: 3) times within a
longer time window (default: 15 days).  Observations within a single
night do not need to be in the same filter, however we will be
constrained by the shallower limiting magnitude of the pair; {\it e.g.}
preferably $r$ band observations would be paired with $i$ rather than
$u$ observations. Finally, the fill factor of the camera is important;
in these simulations we have used the LSST focal plane, which has an
approximately 92\% fill factor.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

The {\tt Discovery Metric} can be used to identify sets of detections
of a particular object that meet the defined criteria for discovery: X
detections within T minutes in a night, Y nights within a W day
window; this describes the number of discovery opportunities for each object.
The results from the Discovery Metric can be fed to the {\tt
  MO\_Completeness} summary metric, where if an object achieves a
user-defined requirement for the minimum number of discovery
opportunities (typically 1), then it is counted as `discovered'; then
the total number of objects discovered at each H magnitude is compared
to the total number of objects in the population at that H magnitude,
in order to evaluate `completeness' as a function of H. Discovery
opportunities can be evaluated as a function of orbital parameters, to
look for areas of orbital space that may be missed in a particular
survey strategy; completeness, since it marginalizes over the entire
population at a particular H value, loses this
capability. Completeness can be evaluated as a differential value
(completeness @ H=X) or integrated over the size distribution
(completeness @ H $\leq$ X).
Figure~\ref{standard_discovery} shows the number of discovery opportunities
and differential completeness as a function of H magnitude
for different populations.

A further simplification of the completeness can be achieved if the
completeness at a particular H magnitude is the desired value. For
example, completeness for PHAs at H=22 is an important summary value.

\subsection{OpSim Analysis of NEO/PHA completeness}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

% \noindent{\it Analysis of NEO/PHA completeness:   ops2\_1094, enigma\_1258, enigma\_1259}

Continuing the analysis of some alternatives to the Baseline Cadence
started in \autoref{chp:cadexp},
we now investigate a suite of observing strategies for their
suitability in supporting Near-Earth Object (NEO) science. As in
that chapter,
% the previous section,
these \OpSim databases are all available for further
testing with science-based MAF metrics.

The U.S. Congress has given a mandate to NASA to implement a
Near-Earth Object (NEO) Survey program to detect, track, catalog,
and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects
equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter\footnote{See
\url{http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ155/pdf/PLAW-109publ155.pdf}}.
The goal is to achieve a completeness of 90\%. In recent practice,
adopted here, the completeness is evaluated for a subset of NEOs
called Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\footnote{Potentially Hazardous
Asteroids (PHAs) are defined as asteroids with a minimum orbit
intersection distance (MOID) of 0.05 AU or less.}  (PHA), with
H$\le$22, where H is the absolute magnitude\footnote{Absolute
magnitude is the magnitude that an asteroid would have at a distance
of 1 AU from the Sun and from the Earth, viewed at zero phase angle.
This is an impossible configuration, of course, but the definition is
motivated by desire to separate asteroid physical characteristics from
the observing configuration.} in the Johnson's V band. While LSST is
very competitive in this context, it will also enable analysis of many
other Solar System populations (e.g.\ main-belt asteroids, comets,
trans-Neptunian objects). Nevertheless, we focus our analysis here on
NEOs/PHAs completeness.


{\bf Motivation and description:}\\
The baseline cadence implements observing strategy with two visits to
a field obtained per night, separated in time by a fraction of an
hour. Motivation for a simulation that does require pairs of visits is
to gauge its impact on the survey efficiency and other performance
parameters. Motivation for simulations with more than two visits to a
given field per night is to investigate the feasibility of a more
robust approach to linking individual detections into a plausible
object track. Although detailed simulations of the performance of
image differencing software and orbital determination software
indicate that two visits per night are likely to be sufficient,
quantitative analysis of other strategies is clearly within the
purview of the cadence optimization program.  Five simulations are
analyzed in this section:

{\bf Expectations:}  Analysis of all simulations is repeated three
times, with different conditions for what constitutes an object's
``discovery'':  two, three or four detections per night are required,
together with at least three such sequences in a 15-day window.  When
only two detections per night are required, a modest decrease in PHA
completeness is expected for simulations that request more than two
visits per night because some visits ``don't live up to their full
potential''. On the other hand, when more than two detections per
night are required, a naive expectation is that PHA completeness for
runs with fewer requested visits will drop significantly. \\

{\bf Analysis Results:}
First, we emphasize that ``requested'' is not the same as
``delivered'': even the ``no pairs''
simulation \opsimdbref{db:NEOsNoVisitPairs} ends
up having multiple visits in a given night to the same fields, and
when multiple visits per night are requested, not all fields get to
have completed sequences. The statistics of how many fields are
combined into sequences of a given number of visits is shown in
\autoref{fig:NvisitStats}.  As evident, the highest peak is at the
requested number of visits in a sequence, but not all visits are
incorporated into requested sequences: some are in both shorter and
longer sequences. In particular, even ``no pairs'' simulation includes
multiple visits to some fields, essentially because the current
version of the algorithm is not told not to do so. As illustrated in
\autoref{fig:intranightgapCompare}, such revisits typically happen
within 10 minutes from the first visit. This (unintended) behavior
implies that the naive expectation above is probably incorrect, as we
discuss in more detail below.


For baseline reference, the PHA completeness for
\opsimdbref{db:baseCadence} is shown in \autoref{fig:enigmaNEO}. The
baseline cadence achieves a cumulative completeness of 73\% for
H$\le$22 PHAs. This cumulative completeness for H$\le$22 is 17\%
higher than differential completeness at H=22 of 56\% due to
increasing completeness towards smaller H (larger objects). Both
differential and cumulative completeness are relevant metrics: the
former provides more insight in the behavior of a particular
simulation, while the latter is a metric given to NASA by the U.S.
Congress. Analysis of results illustrated in \autoref{fig:NEOquads}
can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item When NEO discovery algorithm requires pairs of visits, all runs
have very similar PHA completeness, with quads run only about 2\%
lower than the baseline (a differential completeness of 56\% at H=22
for \opsimdbref{db:baseCadence})
\item When NEO discovery algorithm requires 4 detections per night,
the simulation with quads achieves a differential completeness of
about 27\% at H=22, or  about 30\% lower completeness than Baseline
Cadence.
\item When NEO discovery algorithm requires 4 detections per night,
Baseline Cadence reaches a differential completeness of about 15\% at
H=22 (some quads are unintentionally produced by chance, see
\autoref{fig:NvisitStats}).
\item When NEO discovery algorithm requires 3 detections per night,
runs which requested triples and quads achieve a differential
completeness of about 40\% at H=22 (corresponding to a cumulative
completeness of about 57\% for H$\le$22).
\end{itemize}

Therefore, going from pairs of visits to triples (both for cadence and
NEO detection) reduces completeness (both differential and cumulative)
for PHAs with H$\le$22 by about 15-20\% (and by about 30\% for quads).


\subsubsection{Impact on other science programs}

The impact of requesting sequences with 3 or 4 visits to the same
field on other science programs is not yet analyzed in detail.  The
impact on static science should be minimal, except perhaps for a bit
worse behavior of various systematic errors (because fewer nights,
with their observing conditions, are sampled).

For time-domain science, the mean revisit time will increase by about
50\% if we go from pairs to triples, and by about a factor of two for
quads. This change will have a negative impact on time-domain science
programs based on SNe, variable stars, and transient objects, which
remains to be quantified.
