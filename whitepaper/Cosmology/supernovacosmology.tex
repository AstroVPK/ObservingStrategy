This section is concerned with the detection and characterization of
supernovae (SNe) over time with LSST and their various scientific
applications. A crucial application is the use of supernovae type
Ia (SNIa) and potentially some core-collapse SN (like type IIP) to trace
the recent expansion history of the universe, and confront models of the
physics driving the late time accelerated expansion of the universe.

LSST will improve on past surveys by observing a substantial number of well-characterized 
supernovae, at high redshift. This large sample is not necessarily tied to the large area of LSST 
and can rather be obtained from a relatively small spatio-temporal region with larger numbers of 
well-measured light curves.

On the other hand, the WFD aspect will make the LSST survey 
the first to scan a very large area of the entire Southern sky for
SNe. SNe that are detected and well characterized by LSST can trace
large scale structure in a novel way, and include estimates of radial distances, as 
well as
their own redshift estimates that may be used in conjunction with host
galaxy redshift information. Due to these properties, they can probe the
isotropy of the late time universe.    

In addition, this large sample will
enable further sharpening of our understanding of the properties of the
SN population of different types (see \autoref{sec:SNtransients}). This last point is extremely 
important
for SN cosmology goals as the success of SNIa cosmology has always been
based on the empirical model that intrinsic peak brightnesses are
related to the certain observable characteristics of SNe.  The WFD SNIa
sample will dramatically increase the size of the sample available to
train such an empirical model, as well as understand the probability of
deviations and scatter from this model. Aside from issues like
calibration which need to be addressed separately, a larger sample of
such well measured SNe is probably the only way to address `systematics'
due to deviations from the empirical model. The anticipated sample can
be thought of as consisting of two components:  the low-redshift sample
which is more likely to be complete, and the higher-redshift sample that
will be able to constrain evolution.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

SNe of different types are visible over time scales of about a few
weeks (e.g., type Ia) to nearly a year (type IIP).  During the full
ten-year survey, LSST will scan the entire southern sky repeatedly with
a WFD cadence, and certain specific locations of the sky called the Deep
Drilling Fields (DDF) with special enhanced cadence.

This spatio-temporal window should contain millions
of SNe, that will have apparent magnitudes brighter than the single
exposure limiting magnitude of LSST.  However, the actual sequence of
observations by LSST, defined by the series of field pointing as a
function of time in filter bands (along with weather conditions), will
determine the extent to which each SN can be detected and characterized
well.  Characterization of the SNe is at the core of a number of science
programs that use them as bright, abundant objects with empirically
determined intrinsic brightnesses. 

For LSST, this goal entails: 
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item The detection of SNe \label{it:detection}
\item Photometric classification \label{it:typing}
\item Estimation of photometric redshifts of SNe (or identifying host galaxies and obtaining their
redshifts from photometry or follow-up spectroscopy) \label{it:redshift}
\item Estimation of intrinsic brightnesses of the SNe \label{it:mu}
\item Constructing a Hubble diagram with this data for cosmological inference \label{it:cosmology}
\end{enumerate}

The efficacy
of photometric typing, redshifts and estimation of intrinsic brightnesses
are all dependent on the amount of information available in the observed
light curves of SNe. While these steps are not necessarily independent, it
is useful to think of the requirements on some of these steps separately;
it is not unlikely  that combinations of some of the steps would still be
affected by similar requirements. Ultimately, any cosmological figure of merit (the $w_0-w_a$ 
figure of merit described in \citet{Albrecht2006} for example) will depend on intermediate metrics 
describing each of these steps in turn. Here we focus on steps \ref{it:detection}, \ref{it:typing} 
and \ref{it:mu}, leaving steps \ref{it:redshift} and \ref{it:cosmology} for future work.

{\emph{Supernova detection}}\\
In brief, this process consists of studying a set of image subtractions
between a high-resolution co-added `template' image of a sky section, and a set of
single exposures at different times (usually of lower resolution) of the
same region, after accounting for the different resolutions of images, and
alignments. Studying such image differences is an efficient way to detect
transients such as supernovae, with the probability of inferring the presence
of an object with flux changing in these exposures being related to the change in 
brightness of the object and noise in the image. Combining a set of difference images 
along a supernova light curve results in higher probability of detecting a transient. 

{\emph{Supernova classification}}\\
Because LSST will discover significantly more SNe than can be spectroscopically confirmed, 
automated classification of supernova type from multi-band light curves is crucial. While cosmology 
with a photometric SNe sample with contamination from core collapse SNe is possible (see for 
example \citet{Kunz2007,Newling2011,Hlozek2012,Knights2013,Bernstein2012,Campbell2013,Rubin2015}), 
these methods still benefit from accurate class probabilities from classification algorithms. To 
investigate the effect of observing strategy on SNe classification, we use the multi-faceted machine 
learning pipeline developed in \citet{Lochner2016}.


{\emph{Estimating intrinsic supernova brightness}}\\
The ultimate goal of using SNe (type SNIa or
SNIIP) for cosmology requires estimating the intrinsic brightnesses of
the SN. The first (and sometimes only, depending on the light curve
model) step is fitting the calibrated fluxes to a light curve model with
a set of parameters. According to the ansatz used in SN cosmology, the
intrinsic brightness of SNe is largely determined by the parameters of
the light curve model; hence the uncertainties on the inferred
parameters largely determine the uncertainties on the inferred peak
intrinsic brightness or distance moduli of the SNe. This means the error on the fitted distance 
modulus parameter is a useful proxy for the quality of the light curve and the accuracy of 
the resulting cosmological inference.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}


Since the steps described above are all necessary for determination of
SN intrinsic brightnesses, a metric for supernovae cosmology must
quantify the ability to perform these steps on each supernova of the
sample. To connect this to the output of OpSims, we propose the
following strategy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item study the sequences of observations in small spatial regions
    of the sky so that the sequences of observations relate to positions
    of astrophysical objects like supernovae. This capability is already
    built into \verb MAF ~ with multiple slicers like the
    \verb OpSimFieldSlicer ~ or the \verb Healpixslicer ~. For example, in
    \autoref{fig:SN_sampling}, we show such a sequence for a WFD and
    DDF field for a single year.
    \item On each such spatial region, we look at sliding time windows,
    each time window of size about 70 days (corresponding roughly to a
    supernova Type Ia  lifetime starting 20 days before peak and
    extending to about 50 days after peak). As an example, we choose a
    time window around the night=570, which has an MJD value of 49923
    for both the fields (fieldID: 744 and 309) shown in
    \autoref{fig:SN_sampling} and show the TimeWindow in
    \autoref{fig:TimeWindow}.
    \item  We assign a metric value that we call \textbf{perSNMetric}
    $PM$ to each of these time-windows to estimate the quality of
    observations for a supernova whose rough lifetime matches that time
    window. The prescription for assigning these value to each
    time-window defines our metric and should quantify the success of
    the steps mentioned above. We would expect this value to be a
    function of the properties of the sequence of observations and the
    properties of the transients (SN) being studied. $$ PM =
    PM(\rm{observation Sequence, SN properties})$$
    \item We add up the \textbf{perSNMetric} for the time windows to
    estimate the metric values $M$ for the spatial region of the sky
    surveyed. $$M = \sum_i PM_i. $$ This gives us our final metric $M$. 
\end{itemize}

 Drilling Field in the bottom panel, and the WFD field in the top

 by a red vertical line (which can be used to compare the location to

 309 centered around an MJD of 49823 or a night of 470 which may also be

 heatmap of observations in each filter in each night as in the cadence
 plots of \autoref{fig:SN_sampling}.}
  \label{fig:TimeWindow}
\end{figure}

To define the metric $M,$ we need to define the perSNMetric. Two
different approaches to defining the perSNMetric for a given OpSim run are possible: a) Use
a simulated supernovae Type Ia with specific parameters, observed with
the sequence of observations in the above time-window, and evaluate the
success of each step. b) Study heuristics of the observation sequences by using large simulations 
with randomized parameter values.

Here we will discuss the simpler approach (a). The SN metric in a spatial region
reflects the contribution of the sample of SNe observed in that spatial
region towards inferring the cosmological parameters. Let us
consider a case where each SN observed with conditions better than a
certain threshold contributes equally to the inference. Then the relevant
metric would be a function of the number of SN in the sample passing
such selection criteria. More generally, when the quality of all the
supernovae are not similar, the metric should be thought of as
the weighted sum of supernovae, with the weights being related to the
inverse of the effective variance of the distance modulus:
\begin{equation}
M\sim \sum_i w_i , \qquad  w_i \sim 1.0 /\sigma^2_\mu.
\end{equation}
By comparing with the form of the perSNMetric, we see that the
perSNMetric should be a proxy for $1.0/\sigma^2_\mu,$ where
$\sigma^2_\mu$ is the effective variance on the distance
modulus of the supernova, as determined by fitting an empirical model to the supernova light curve.

%\subsubsection{ Steps in the PerSNMetric}
\subsubsection{Steps in the PerSNMetric}
As described before, the measurement of the distance modulus is the
result of several steps. Therefore, we expect the perSNMetric to be a
product of metrics in each of the steps:

\begin{equation}
PM_i = \prod_{\rm{steps}} PM_i^{\rm{steps}}
\end{equation}

These components of perSNMetric constructed in different steps are
described in \autoref{tab:stepsAndMetrics}.
\begin{center}
 \begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{| p{5cm} |p{10cm}| }
\hline Metric & Description \\
\hline
I. SN discovery  &  Given the observations in a time window corresponding to the lifetime of a supernova, evaluate the  probability of detecting a
transient \\
II. SN classification & Given the observations in a time window corresponding to the lifetime of a 
supernova, evaluate the probability of accurately classifying the transient\\
III. SN light curve characterization quality & Given the observations in a time window corresponding to the lifetime of a supernova, evaluate the quality of characterization\\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Components of the perSNMetric}
\label{tab:stepsAndMetrics}
\end{table}
\end{center}



\emph{I. Discovery Metric}

This metric is a proxy for the probability of detecting a SN as a
transient from the set of single epoch (visit) exposures during the
lifetime of a supernova. Here we assume that a single detection out of
these visits is sufficient to identify the source as a transient. This
probability is constructed by comparing the probability of transient
detection for a point source of given SNR and filter band for a single
visit and the set of SNR values of a supernova based on the observation
sequences. This single visit probability currently uses an approximation
from previous surveys (in particular a SNR-efficiency curve constructed
from the Dark Energy Survey, and provided by R. Kessler, priv.
communication).


\emph{II. Classification Metric}

The classification metric is based on the output of the multifaceted
machine learning classification system described in Section
\ref{sec:\secname:targets}. For a given set of supernovae (simulated or
real), we run the classification pipeline producing a probability of
belonging to each class of supernova, for each object. The success of
the classification can be evaluated in several ways. Here, to allow a
general and robust metric, we use receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves.

Most machine learning algorithms are capable of producing an estimate of
the probability for each class, rather than just a single
classification. Varying the threshold probability at which one considers
an object belonging to a particular class can dramatically change the
resulting classification. For example, requiring a threshold probability
of 0.99 for an object to be considered a type Ia would result in an
extremely pure Ia sample, albeit a rather small one as many objects
would be missed. Thus classification problems always result in a
trade-off between purity and completeness. This is illustrated by ROC
curves (see \autoref{fig:roc}), where the false positive rate
(contamination) is plotted against the true positive rate
(completeness), as a function of probability threshold.


\emph{III. Quality Metric}

We construct the quality metric for the perSNmetric by obtaining the
light curve of the SN in the time window described above. We fit the
light curve, and approximately estimate the uncertainty in distance from
the light curve fit alone. Of course, as is well known, luminosity
distance estimates of supernova Type Ia also show an intrinsic scatter
of around $0.1$ in previous surveys, which may be expected to decrease
with better training samples and understanding of underlying
correlations of SNIa properties and their environments. We compute a
quality metric for each SNIa as the ratio of the square of the
uncertainty of the distance indicator from the supernova to the square
of the intrinsic dispersion. When added up over SN to obtain a value
$QM$, the uncertainty on cosmological parameters may be expected to
scale as $\sim sqrt(1.0 + \sum QM)$ The quality metric evaluated on the
example SN plotted is $1.$ if observed in the deep field, and $0.002$ in
the WFD field.

{\bf Motivation and description:}

The scientific goal of characterizing SNe is to a large extent dependent
on how well the light curves of individual SNe are sampled in time and
filters. To study this, we re-index the OpSim output on spatial
locations rather than use the temporal index. Here we first illustrate
in terms the cadence in an example LSST field. Our primary goal for
optimal Observing Strategy for SN observations is to obtain 7-10 epochs
spread over 50 days or so for more than one filter {\it (we will
quantify the minimum filters later in the Section)}. This will increase
the number of well-measured SNe at low redshift (z$<$ 1) and improve
distinguishing SN Ia from other types of SNe.

We analyzed the OpSim output of the Baseline Observing Strategy,
enigma$\_$1189$\_$sqlite.db{\footnote
{\url{http://ops2.tuc.noao.edu/runs/}}} which includes Deep Drilling
Fields (DDF) and the main survey (WFD). Using the OpSim output \verb
enigma_1189, we generated light curves for type Ia supernovae with a
typical property with a redshift of z=0.5 toward a few different
locations. A date in MJD is chosen where the LSST simulated data are
mostly or reasonably well populated. We used the SALT2-extended model
with $x1, c=0$ and $x_0 $ set so that the SNIa would have a specific
magnitude of $-19.3$ in the rest frame BessellB band. This was performed
using a version of SNCosmo to interpolate the SALT2 surfaces, and the
LSST catalog simulation package to calculate the flux for LSST
bandpasses. \autoref{fig:SNIaLCopsimdeep} shows light curves in
different filters towards a deep drilling field (R.A., Decl.). The
number of visits for 50 days (which is the perid of SNIa light curve in
rest-frame and it is 75 days at z=0.5) is 53 per filter. Using the light
curves, we estimated both the supernova quality metric (SNQM) and the
discovery metric (SNDM), and find that the quality of SNQM and SNDM is
1, respectively. SNDM=1 indicates that this object is a transient that
will be definitely discovered, and SNQM=1 indicates that the light
curves will be of high quality enough to contribute extremely well to
the inference of cosmological parameters. The light curves and
quantified Metric demonstrate that data from Deep Drilling Fields would
generate high quality light curves, allowing a high rate of supernova
discovery.

In contrast, light curves in different filters from the Main Survey in
\autoref{fig:SNIaLCopsimmain} are limited. This light curve is
generated towards Field 290 (R.A. of 6.097$^{\circ}$ and Decl. of
-1.105$^{\circ}$; see \autoref{fig:perSNCadence}). An average number
of data points in the light curve is 2 per filter. Using these light
curves, the probability (SNDM) we estimated this object as a SN is less
than 0.1.


\new{We have examined the number of simulated LSST data points by
selecting 16 positions on the sky as listed in \autoref{tab:lcpositions} .
Our goal is to generate various light curves of SNe, to apply our
metrics and to quantify the quality of LSST data using the OpSim output.
The positions are randomly selected, but to cover the entire, available
sky from LSST, and serve as a set of representative positions. The first
column ``Field'' is LSST fieldID of WFD or the number in the entry of
position in the table. Deep drilling field is marked as ``DDF''. The
second column is R.A. and Decl. in degree and the third column is the
number of LSST data points measured for the first year of LSST mission
and those of each filter are marked in parenthesis as an order of
(u,g,r,i,z,y) filter. Fourth column (Avg. No.) indicates an average
number per filter for 50 days derived from the LSST data points (the
number of LSST data points in the value of column 3 is divided by 6
(filters) and multiplied by the scaled number of days, 50/365). Note
that our scientific goal is to obtain 7-9 data points per SN Ia light
curve period. In column 5, we categorize the positions into 5 categories
base on the data points (the value in column 3) per filter for 50 days.
When the number of LSST data points (the value in column 3) per filter
for 50 days is $>$9 as the category A, 5-9 as B, 1.8 -- 5 for C, 1 --
1.8 for D, and $<$1 for E. An example of light curve of Category A has
been shown in Figure \ref{fig:SNIaLCopsimdeep}, Examples light curves of
Category B have been shown in Figures \ref{fig:SNIaLCopsimmain} and
\ref{fig:SNIaLCopsimmain2}, respectively. An example of a light curve of

\new{An example of Category B toward -66$^{\circ}$ is shown

light curves in {\it u, g} and {\it r} bands have 3 -- 5 data points,
while {\it i} band has 8 or more than data points. The band z and y show
relatively large error bars. In order to increase probability to
recognize the light curve as a SN and Type Ia, simulated LSST data
points could be increased by a factor of 2-3. Our goal is to improve the
light curves which belong to Category B and C so that we can distinguish
them as a SN and particularly as a Type Ia SN. This will improve values
in SNDM and SNQM.}

\subsection{Rolling Cadence of the Main Survey Optimized for Supernova Science}

\subsubsection{ Scientific Motivation for Rolling-Cadence}

The main survey is important for the discovery of supernovae (SNe) in
the redshift range of 0.1- 1, which is critical to constraint SN
cosmological parameters. In order to identify a variable source as a SN
and to distinguish the source as a Type Ia SN, we need 7-10 epochs
spread over 45 days or so for each filter based on past experience.
Universal survey of the Baseline Cadence provides 6 filter data for
approximately 18 days (assuming a survey with a filter can be done for 3
days). This provides 15 data points over 45 days and 2.5 data points in
average for each filter. Our analysis of OpSim run (Baseline Observing
Strategy) output shows the light curves of SNe from the OpSim data are
insufficient not only to identify the source as a SN and but also to
classify the SN if the SN is type Ia or II (or Ib, Ic). Our proposed
observing strategy is critical to improve the quality of SN light
curves. The light curves will have at least 3 times densely populated
data points in time.

\subsubsection{Proposed Rolling-Cadence of the Main Survey Optimized for SN Science }
%\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

{\it Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
made to improve this science project's figure of merit, and mitigate
the identified risks?}

Our goal for observing strategy optimized for SN cosmology is to
obtain 7-10 epochs spread over 50 days or so for more than one filter. We suggest to
change the filter every day and LSST can choose a part of sky which has the best airmass,
centered on Zenith. LSST will observe about 1/3 of visible sky per day (to be confirmed).
LSST can observe the same part of sky for 6 days with 6 filters, and repeat 9 times for
the same field. This observing strategy will result in 54 visits (with 6 different
filters) for the same field. We repeat the same for Field 2 which takes another 54 days.
Then observe Field 3 for another 54 days.

We propose a new Observing Strategy of the main survey (the Universal Cadence area;
WFD) in order to generate 3 times densely populated SN light curves in time (i.e. 3
times higher samples for a SN light curve). Our main goal is to obtain 7-10 epochs
spread over 45 days per filter. For simplicity, we assume the main survey will cover
available sky (2293 fields) for 3 days (we divide the available sky into 3 separate
Sectors, which would be called Sector 1 and 2 and 3. Each Sector of the sky
corresponds to ~764 fields. The sum of Sector 1 and 2 and 3 is 2293 fields, a total
number of LSST fields from the Universal Cadence area. For a day, 1/3 of available
sky would be observed. By changing the filter, every day, it will take 6 days to
observe 6 filters for 1/3 of available sky. We repeat 9 times for the same Sector of
sky, which will result in 54 visits (with 6 different filters) for the same Sector
(1/3 of available sky). We repeat the same for the 2nd Sector of sky which takes
another 54 days. Then we observe the 3rd Sector for another 54 days.

To visualize this idea, we list our proposed observing strategy day by day; Day 1 :
Filter 1 (for the 1st Sector), Day 2: Filter 2 (for the 1st Sector), Day 3: Filter 3
(for the 1st Sector), Day 4: Filter 4 (for the 1st Sector), Day 5: Filter 5 (for the
1st Sector), and Day 6: Filter 6 (for the 1st Sector). Repeat this sequence 9 times
for the 1st Sector. This will generate 54 data points for 54 days for a supernova and
9 data points in average for each filter. This is approximately 3 times higher sample
of data for 54 days than those from the Universal Cadence. Observe the same sequences
for the 2nd Sector (it takes 54 days) and then do the same for the 3rd Sector of sky
(it takes another 54 days). This summarizes overall idea, but since visible sky is
slightly different every day and observation depends on the weather, an OpSim run is
needed accounting for all of these factors (and maybe other factors that we haven't
mentioned here). One may also consider to observe each Sector for 108 days (2x54
days) instead of 54 days; this may allow us to discover a higher number of SNe in
stead of for 54 days. Our suggestion is mainly for the sky of Galactic latitude
greater than 30 degree (|l| > 30) since it would be hard to discover SNe at the
Galactic plane.

\subsubsection{Expectations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item SN light curves would have 3 times more densely populated in time as we have designed.
\item An average airmass of the Main Survey would be significantly lower.
\item Significantly higher number of SN discovery can be expected because its impact area is
large. The average number of visits per filter for 50 days is only $\sim$2 for the regions
located from Dec. -65 to Dec. 0 based on Baseline Observing Strategy, but the number would
be $\sim$6 with our proposed rolling cadence.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intrinsic Dispersion, environmental effects, newer analysis methods
\item Follow-up
procedures: What is feasible? Where will our training samples for classification and light
curve models come from (other experiments, our own sub-samples with spectroscopic
follow-up?), spectroscopic follow-up of host galaxies. Can hosts be identified?
\item `Systematics': In what ways will the real data not match the assumptions made in analysis.
Having a large sample of SN, to understand the astrophysics would be useful for this.
\end{itemize}
