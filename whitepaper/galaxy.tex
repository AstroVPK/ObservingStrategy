LSST's large survey grasp will yield significant contributions to
essentially all areas of Galactic astronomy. Science cases for Milky
Way astronomy with LSST cover lengthscales from a few pc (such as
sensitive surveys of low-mass objects in the Solar Neighborhood), up
to many tens of kpc (such as sensitive surveys for low-mass satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way and their post-disruption remnant streams,
and beyond this, investiations of resolved stellar populations in the
Local Volume). 

Because the diversity of science cases in the Milky Way is so vast, we
make no attempt to be comprehensive. Much more detail about most of
the LSST science cases, and specific science questions to be answered,
can be found in the LSST Science Book (particularly chapters 6 and 7)
and Ivezic et al. (2008 arXiv 0805.2366, in particular Sections 2.1.4
and 4.4 of that document). In this chapter we present a few
representative science cases that illustrate trade-offs between
observing strategies, for programs at low galactic latitudes as well
as away from the disk, and for programs requiring sufficient cadence
for variability as well as deep integrated imaging. 

As with the rest of this whitepaper, our intention is to provoke the
astronomical community to contribute to the optimization of LSST's
observing strategy. Readers who find that an important area of Milky
Way astronomy is under-served by the treatment here, are welcome to
contact the editors to get involved and contribute improvements. For
example, while inclusion of the inner Galactic plane in the
Wide-Fast-Deep survey would allow characterization of important
populations through variability (as will be shown quantitatively in
Section 4.3), such a dataset would also be of immense value in
disentangling and measuring structural parameters of major galactic
components (for example the tilt angle of the disk and the effects of
radial migration within it). We welcome further development of
quantitative metrics by which the appropriateness of LSST's observing
strategies can be assessed in terms of the science of interest to the
reader.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:MW_Halo}
assesses the degree to which structures in the Milky Way's halo can be
discriminated and mapped, using tracer populations distinguished by
variability and derived stellar parameters. Section \ref{sec:MW_Disk}
assesses the impact of observing strategy on LSST's ability to map
some representative astrophysically important populations that are
found mostly or exclusively in the Plane (including Dust in the
ISM). \new{(If there is time before posting:)} Section \ref{sec:MW_Bulge}
describes an example use of LSST to set constraints on Galactic
components, while Section \ref{sec:MW_LocalVolume} explores the use of
LSST to probe the Local Volume.

Several observational challenges for LSST find their sharpest
expression in Milky Way science, including (but not limited to)
measurements of stellar parallax, absolute astrometry, and proper
motions (including the tie-in to the reference frame which will be
provided by the {\it Gaia} mission). For this reason, specific issues
relating to precision astrometry are developed in Section
\ref{sec:MW_Astrometry}.
