\section{Introduction}
\def\secname{MW_Intro}\label{sec:\secname}

\new{LSST's large survey grasp will yield significant contributions to
essentially all areas of Galactic astronomy. LSST Milky Way science
cases cover lengthscales ranging from a few pc (such as sensitive
surveys of low-mass objects in the Solar Neighborhood), up to many
tens of kpc (such as surveys for low-mass satellite galaxies of the
Milky Way and their post-disruption remnant streams, and beyond this,
investigations of resolved stellar populations in the Local
Volume). Because the diversity of science cases in the Milky Way is so
vast, we make no attempt to be comprehensive. Much more detail about
most of the LSST science cases, and specific science questions to be
answered, can be found in the LSST Science Book (particularly chapters
6 and 7) and Ivezic et al. (2008 arXiv 0805.2366, in particular
Sections 2.1.4 and 4.4 of that document).\footnote{We do however provide motivating details for certain science cases in this Chapter, particularly in Section \ref{sec:MW_Disk}, as those cases are not emphasized in the LSST Science Book or the relevant sections of Ivezic et al. (2008).} As with the rest of this whitepaper, we
intend to provoke the reader to contribute to the optimization of
LSST's observing strategy.}

\new{Concern about observations towards the inner Galactic Plane has
  been a common theme in feedback on LSST's observing strategy, as the
  Baseline survey currently expends relatively little observing time
  per field at low Galactic latitudes\footnote{At the time of
    writing, observations towards the inner Plane still seem to be
    compromised further by the way OpSim arranges shorter programs to
    completion at early times in the simulated survey. This reduces
    the time baseline available for inner-Plane measurements by a
    significant factor compared to observations away from the Plane
    (see e.g. Figure \ref{fig_astrom_ByTime_pmError} in Section
    \ref{sec:MW_Astrometry:MW_Astrometry_OpSim}, in which the entirety
    of the observed Plane is visible as a region of substantially
    coarser proper motion measurement compared to high latitude
    regions).}. Even without the machinery of the Metrics and Figures
  of Merit, populations only found in scientifically interesting
  numbers in at low Galactic latitudes seem likely to be detected only
  with low efficiency by LSST under the Baseline strategy. (An example
  is the probing of the mass function of moderate-separation
  extrasolar planets via intra-disk planetary microlensing, as argued
  forcefully in Gould 2013 arXiv 1304.3455). Having stated this,
  however, our expectation is that the evaluation of the Figures of
  Merit laid out in this Chapter will, as a by-product, {\it
    quantitatively} show how a range of Milky Way science cases will
  be substantially improved by enhanced Plane coverage, at little or
  no cost to the rest of LSST's scientific investigations.}

\new{At the time of writing (April 2016), we explore the scientific
  impact of shallow Plane observations by comparing Metrics and
  Figures of Merit evaluated for the Baseline cadence
  (\opsimdbref{db:baseCadence}) and for the PanSTARRS-like strategy
  (\opsimdbref{db:opstwoPS}), the latter of which has essentially uniform depth at all Galactic latitudes observed. The OpSim team is working to complete the proposed Wide-Fast-Deep-Plane survey (OpSim proposal {\tt Proposal\_GP.md}), and the results of the Figure of Merit evaluations on this new run will be incorporated into this chapter as they become available.}

\subsection{Chapter terminology and structure}

To try to tame the diversity of science cases, we have picked
representative cases and grouped them within broad scientific areas,
devoting one Section of this chapter to each grouping of cases. A
small number of Figures of Merit (FoMs) have been described for each
case. For each of the groupings of science cases, a summary Table is
provided that will present the figure of merit for each science case
within that section (as columns) for each tested observing strategy
(as rows).

At present, science cases are grouped in the following way:
Section~\ref{sec:MW_Halo} assesses the degree to which structures in the Milky
Way's halo can be discriminated and mapped, using tracer populations
distinguished by variability and derived stellar parameters.
Section~\ref{sec:MW_Disk} assesses the impact of observing strategy on LSST's
ability to map some representative astrophysically important
populations that are found mostly or exclusively in the Plane
(including Dust in the ISM). Several observational challenges for LSST
find their sharpest expression in Milky Way science, including (but
not limited to) measurements of stellar parallax, absolute astrometry,
and proper motions (including the tie-in to the reference frame which
will be provided by the \textit{Gaia} mission). For this reason, specific
issues relating to precision astrometry are developed in
Section~\ref{sec:MW_Astrometry}.

Section \ref{sec:MW_Future} presents descriptions of investigations
that are needed to properly determine LSST's utility for Milky Way
science, but which at this date (mid-April 2016) are as-yet relatively
incompletely developed. Examples identified at this stage include the
uses of LSST to set constraints on Galactic components.

\new{2016-04-25: recently-added contributions on Dust and
  Star-formation history will be incorporated into this structure as
  appropriate. At present ($\sim$4:00pm Eastern) we are expecting more input very shortly from a contributor.}

\subsection{Summary tables for Figures of Merit}

The tables below organize the comparison of Figures of Merit for all
the science cases considered in this chapter:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mapping the Milky Way Halo: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWHalo}
  \item Mapping the Milky Way Disk: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWDisk}
  \item Astrometry with LSST: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWAstrometry}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Needed input}

While many of the diagnostic Metrics are relatively well-developed,
implementation is needed of Figures of Merit (FoMs) that depend on
these metrics. In some Sections we have sketched out such figures of
merit, in others the development of a practical FoM is still a topic
of active development.
