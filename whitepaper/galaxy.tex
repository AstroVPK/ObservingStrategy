LSST's large survey grasp will lead it to make significant
contributions to essentially all areas of Galactic astronomy. Science
cases for Milky Way astronomy with LSST cover lengthscales from a few
pc (such as sensitive surveys of low-mass objects in the Solar
Neighborhood), up to many tens of kpc (such as sensitive surveys for
low-mass satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and their post-disruption
remnant streams, and beyond this, investiations of resolved stellar
populations in the Local Volume).

Because the diversity of science cases in the Milky Way is so vast, we
make no attempt to be comprehensive here. Much more detail about most
of the LSST science cases, and specific science questions to be
answered, can be found in the LSST Science Book (particularly chapters
6 and 7) and Ivezic et al. (2008 arXiv 0805.2366, in particular
Sections 2.1.4 and 4.4 of that document). In this chapter we focus on
a few representative science cases that illustrate the trade-offs
between different possible observing strategies.

As with the rest of this whitepaper, our intention is to provoke the
astronomical community to contribute to the optimization of
LSST. Readers who feel that their favorite area of Galactic astronomy
is being under-served by the treatment herein and in the documents
referenced above, are welcome to contact the writing team to suggest
improvements. 

This chapter is mostly organized around the following science cases:
Firstly, the degree to which structures in the Milky Way's halo can be
discriminated and mapped, using tracer populations both in variability
and stellar parameters, is described in Section \ref{MW_Halo}. Near
the other end of the distance-scale, LSST can map certain important
populations throughout the disk that would be difficult to trace with
any other facility; examples are shown in Section
\ref{MW_Plane}. \new{(If there is time before posting:)} Section
\ref{MW_Bulge} describes an example use of LSST to set constraints on
Galactic components, while Section \ref{MW_LocalVolume} explores the
use of LSST to probe the Local Volume.

Several observational challenges find their sharpest expression in
Milky Way science, including (but not limited to) measurements of
stellar parallax, absolute astrometry, and proper motions (including
the tie-in to the reference frame which will be provided by the {\it
  Gaia} mission). For this reason, specific issues relating to
precision astrometry are developed in Section \ref{MW_Astrometry}.

\new{The suggestion has been made for another subsection tying these science strands together.}
