The basic figure of merit for AGN science is the total number of AGNs
discovered in the entire LSST survey, as a function of luminosity and
redshift. The main goal is therefore to adjust the Observing Strategy
in order to maximize this number.
%The primary goal for AGN science is to maximize the discovery of AGN
%with the LSST and construct the largest possible inventory of sources
%spanning the widest possible ranges in the redshift-luminosity parameter
%space. This, in turn, will provide 
Doing so will provide tighter constraints within the context
of various cosmological science cases, such as quasar clustering,
$z>6$ quasars and reionization, and strong gravitational lensing.

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

It is expected that $\approx 10^7 - 10^8$ AGNs will be selected in the
main LSST survey using a combination of criteria, split broadly into
four categories: colors, astrometry, variability, and multiwavelength
matching with other surveys \citep{2009arXiv0912.0201L, 2013AAS...22124710S}.
The LSST Observing strategy will mostly affect the first three of these
categories as described further below.

{\bf Colors:} The LSST observing strategy will determine the depth in each band,
as a function of position on the sky, and will thus affect the color selection
of AGNs. Additionally, it will affect the reliability of the actual
determination of the color, due to the non-negligible time gaps between
observations using two different filters for a particular LSST field. This will
eventually determine the AGN $L-z$ distribution and, in particular, may affect
the identification of quasars at $z\gtsim 6$ if, for example, $Y$-band exposures
will not be sufficiently deep.

{\bf Variability:} AGNs can be effectively distinguished from (variable)
stars, and from quiescent galaxies, by exhibiting certain characteristic
variability patterns (e.g., \citealt{ButlerandBloom2011}). Picking the
right cadence can increase the effectiveness of AGN selection. Ultimately,
hybrid color and variability algorithms will be employed to enhance
the selection process (e.g., \citealt{Petersetal2015}); this may be
particularly important for selecting obscured sources which comprise a
significant fraction of the entire AGN population.

%Non-uniform
%sampling may ``contaminate'' the variability signal of AGN candidates.

{\bf Astrometry:} In cases where selection by color and variability is
insufficient for a reliable identification, AGNs can be further selected
among sources having zero proper motion, within the uncertainties. The
LSST cadence may affect the level of this uncertainty in each band, and
may therefore affect the ability to identify (mostly fainter) AGN.
%
Differential chromatic refraction (DCR), making use of the astrometric offset a
source with emission lines has with respect to a source with a featureless
power-law spectrum, can help in the selection of AGNs and in confirming their
photometric redshifts \citep{KaczmarczikEtal2009}. The DCR effect is more
pronounced at higher airmasses. Therefore, it could be advantageous to have at
least one visit, per source, at airmass greater than about 1.4 (though of course
there are trade-offs versus the additional extinction, for faint sources). AGN
selection and photometric redshift confirmation may be affected since the LSST
cadence will affect the airmass distribution, in each band, for each AGN
candidate.
%
The deep drilling fields (DDFs) will provide a truth table for determining
the predictive power of the DCR method as a function of the airmass
distribution of the observations.

The most critical measurement for the AGN census is having a reliable
and precise redshift for each source, obtained both from a photometric
and an `astrometric' redshift from DCR.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

% \subsection{Metrics}
\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

% Ideas for Metrics:
% detection - how many can LSST detect based on the luminosity function
% (depends on the depth in each band for single epoch and coadd)
% (how will this change with each DR)? @ohadshemmer

% classification - How many of these will we actually classify as quasars?
% non-simultaneous colors. variability of QSOs (how does depend on
% cadence/baseline/seasonal gaps?)

The following are most important for the AGN census:

1) Determine the mean (averaged across the sky) {\bf uncertainty on astrometric
redshifts derived from DCR} as a function of airmass, image quality, and
limiting magnitude. These uncertainties should be compared to the
corresponding uncertainties on the photomteric redshift.

2) Estimate the {\bf number of quasars at $z>6$ that LSST can discover}
during a single visit, as well as in the entire survey, and verify that
these numbers do not fall short of the original predictions. This
simply requires computing the maximum depth in the $Y$-band (for both 
single visits and the coadd), averaged across the sky for the nominal
OpSim, as well as assessing the ability to reject L and T dwarfs via astrometry.

3) Assess the effect of {\bf non-simultaneous colors on AGN selection.}
First, the term color should be clearly defined. Potential definitions
include the difference between the co-adds in two bands for the entire
survey (or at a certain point in time during the survey), the difference
between the mdian magnitude in each band during the survey, or the
difference between observations in two bands that are closely spaced in time.
Next, each source would be represented as an ellipse in color-color space.
The aim is to assess the sizes of the ellipses and how these sizes could be
minimized by perturbing the current cadence.

4) Asses how the sampling affects the selection of AGN by variability (e.g.,
interactions with red-noise power spectrum).

%4) Estimate the number of low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) that can be
%identified during the entire survey.

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

% OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
% the time of writing for this science project?

\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/agn/zgt6_figure_AAS_2013.png}
\caption{Number of quasars at $z>6$ that LSST is expected to discover
based on $Y$-band limiting magnitude in a single epoch (entire survey)
marked by the first (second) dotted line from the left.}
\label{fig:zgt6}
\end{figure}


For assessing the limitations of DCR on the $L-z$ plane of LSST AGNs,
one needs to obtain from OpSim the current maximal airmasses for each band,
and the associated image quality and limiting magnitude. The current maximal
airmasses, per band, averaged across the sky are: 1.41, 1.50, 1.51, 1.51, 1.51,
and 1.51 for $u, g, r, i, z, Y$, respectively. Need to convolve this with the
seeing in each band to obtain the dependence on airmass and image
quality. This output should be converted into the mean and spread
of the uncertainty on the astrometric redshifts. The best way
to obtain this is to fold the astrometric redshift estimation from
DCR into MAF. Ultimately, one needs to check the implications of higher
airmasses and limiting magnitudes on the ability to obtain more accurate
and precise astrometric redshifts.


For predicting the number of detected $z>6$ quasars
%Compare this magnitude to the
%one required for identifying $\geq1000$ quasars at $z\geq6$.
the current 
%enigma\_1189{}
aquila\_{}1110 OpSim for the main, i.e., WFD survey, gives a
single-visit $5\sigma$-depth
%old number computed in Bremerton: $Y=22.36$ mag,
%$Y=21.51$ enigma_\_{}1189
{\it Y} $= 21.45$ mag as compared to {\it Y} $= 21.51$ for the older enigma\_{}1189 OpSim.
For the final co-added $5\sigma$-depth the median magnitude from the aquila\_{}1110
OpSim is 
%$Y=24.36$. Enigma\_{}1189
{\it Y}$ = 23.07$ which is more than a magnitude shallower than the older enigma\_{}1189 
depth of {\it Y}$ = 24.36$.
{\bf The lower {\it Y}-band depth may reduce the total number of quasars at $z > 6$ discovered by LSST by
a factor of $\sim 2$
%correspondingly deeper (i.e., better) than enigma\_{}1189
%comparable to
%the original predictions
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:zgt6}).}

As for general AGN selection, the effects of the sampling on variability selection
should be assessed, and the amplitudes of the uncertainties in color-color space
and how these depend on the cadence should be simulated.

\subsection{Ten Questions}

GTR will answer Zeljko's 10 questions here.

1) Can you place constraints on the tradeoff between the sky coverage and coadded depth?
For example, should we maximize the sky coverage (to ~30,000 sq. deg., as e.g. Pan-STARRS)
or the number of detected galaxies (the current baseline with 18,000 sq. deg.)?

A: Weak lensing science scales with the number of well-measured galaxies. The main
survey area should be optimized to maximize the size of galaxy sample.

2) Can you place constraints on the trade between uniformity of sampling and frequency of
sampling? For example, a rolling cadence can provide enhanced sample rates over part or all
of the survey part of the time, at the cost of reduced sample rate the rest of the time (while
maintaining the nominal total visit counts).

A: For Type Ia SNe science, light-curve sampling should be about twice as frequent as
for the current baseline cadence. The benefits of this improved sampling would outweigh
the loss of active sky area.

3) Can you place constraints on the tradeoff between the single-visit depth and the number
of visits? Especially in the u band, where longer exposures would minimize the impact of the
readout noise.

A: The single-visit depth required for detecting RR Lyrae stars to the presumed tidal radius
of the Milky Way is at least r~24.5. The single-visit depth required for detecting SNe to redshifts
of about 1, that can be probed with LSST filter complement, is at least r~24.5. The increased
number of visits that could be obtained with shallower data would not benefit either science
case.

4) Can you place constraints on the Galactic plane coverage (spatial coverage, temporal
sampling, visits per band)?

A: Our science program cannot place any constraints on the Galactic plane coverage.

5) Can you place constraints on the fractions of observing time allocated to each band?

A: Photometric redshift estimates for galaxies require that each band receives at least
10% of the total observing time.

6) Can you place constraints on the cadence for deep drilling fields?

A: In order to obtain good light-curve templates for SNe, at least one deep drilling field
has to be observed each night in all 6 bands for at least 4 months.

7) Assuming two visits per night, should they be obtained in the same band or not?

A: The completeness considerations for asteroids suggest that two visits in a given
night should be obtained with the same band.

8) Would your science benefit from a special cadence prescription during commissioning or
early in the survey, such as: acquiring a full 10-yr count of visits for a small area (either in
all or in selected bands); a greatly enhanced cadence for a small area.

A: The deep drilling fields with multi-wavelength data would enable early science results
if LSST data were obtained early.

9) Do you have constraints for sampling of observing conditions (e.g. seeing, dark sky,
airmass), possibly as a function of band, etc.?

A: Weak lensing science would greatly benefit if the r and i band data were obtained during
the best seeing nights.

10) Do you have science drivers that would require real-time exposure time optimization
to obtain nearly constant single-visit limiting depth?

A: Science programs requiring a minimum single-visit depth (such as Near-Earth Object
survey) would benefit from its uniform distribution.
