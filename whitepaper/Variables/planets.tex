This section describes the unique discovery space for
extrasolar planets with LSST, namely,
planets in relatively unexplored environments.

% \subsubsection{Planets In Relatively Unexplored Environments}

A large number of exoplanets have been discovered over the past few
decades, with over 1500 exoplanets now confirmed. These discoveries are
primarily the result of two detection methods: The radial velocity (RV)
method where the planet's minimum mass is measured, and the transit
method where the planet radius is measured and RV follow-up allows the
measurement of the planet's mass and hence mean density. Other methods
are curently being developed and use to discover an increasing number of
planets, inclduing the microlensing method and direct imaging. In
addition, the Gaia mission is expected to discover a large number of
planets using astrometry (Perryman et al.~2014,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...797...14P).

The {\it Kepler} mission has an additional almost 4000 planet
candidates. While these planet candidates have not been confirmed, the
sample is significant enough that planet characteristics can be studied
statistically, including radius and period distributions and planet
occurrence rates. LSST will extend previous transiting planet searches
by observing stellar populations that have generally not been
well-studied by previous transiting planet searches, including star
clusters, the galactic bulge, red dwarfs, white dwarfs (see below), and
the magellanic clouds (see Section~7). Most known exoplanets have been
found relatively nearby, as exoplanet systems with measured distances
have a median distance of around 80~pc, and 80\% of these systems are
within 320~pc (exoplanets.org). LSST is able to recover transiting
exoplanets at much larger distances, including in the galactic bulge and
the Large Magellanic Cloud, allowing for measurements of planet
occurrence rates in these other stellar environments (Lund
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2305v2.pdf, Jacklin
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00059v2.pdf). Red dwarfs have often been
underrepresented in searches that have focused on solar-mass stars,
however red dwarfs are plentiful, and better than 1 in 7 are expected to
host earth-sized planets in the habitable zone (Dressing
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01623v2.pdf).

Another currently unexplored environment where LSST will be able to
probe the exoplanet population is planets orbiting white dwarfs (WDs).
Such systems teach us about the future evolution of planetary systems
with main-sequence primaries, including that of the Solar System. When a
WD is eclipsed by a planet (or any other faint low-mass object,
including a brown dwarf or a small star) the radius and temperature
ratios lead to a very deep eclipse, possibly a complete occultation,
where during eclipse the target can drop below the detection threshold.
The existence of planets orbiting WDs has been suggested observationally
(e.g., Farihi et al.~2009,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...694..805F; Jura et al.~2009,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....137.3191J; Zuckerman et
al.~2010, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...722..725Z; Debes et
al.~2012, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...747..148D) and
theoretically (e.g., Nordhaus et al.~2010,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.408..631N). A few brown dwarf
companions were already discovered (e.g., Maxted et al.~2006,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Natur.442..543M; Casewell et
al.~2012,http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...759L..34C; Littlefair
et al.~2006, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Sci...314.1578L, 2014,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.2106L), and Vanderburg et
al.~(2015, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015Natur.526..546V; see also
Croll et al.~2015, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151006434C;
Gansicke et al.~2016, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...818L...7G;
Rappaport et al.~2016,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160200740R) recently discovered a
disintegrating planetary body orbiting a WD.

While most of the sky that LSST will survey will be at much lower
cadences than transiting planet searches employ, a sufficient
understanding of the LSST efficiency for detecting planets combined with
the large number of targets may still provide significant results.
Additionally, the multiband nature of LSST provides an extra benefit, as
exoplanet transits are achromatic while many potential astrophysical
false positives, such as binary stars, are not.
