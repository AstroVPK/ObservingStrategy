\section{Introduction}


Explosive and eruptive transients include a physically and
phenomenologically diverse ensemble of objects.   What these events share
are rare, large-amplitude deviations from a quiescent state.  These
outbursts are typically unpredictable and of limited duration, and so their
discovery and characterization are sensitive to the detailed observing
strategy.  Often, followup observations with other facilities can provide
significant additional scientific value, but this creates a challenge to
identify candidate events while they are still visible.

Transients such as novae, supernovae (SNe), and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
probe the final stages of stellar evolution. Tidal Disruption Events
(TDEs), short GRBs, and
Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) give us the opportunity to study
compact and binary objects. Massive star eruptions allow us to understand
mass loss mechanisms and chemical enrichment. 
The brightest transients (GRBs, TDEs,
SNe) are light beams that can be seen over cosmic distances, and some
transients---most notably Type Ia SNe---are cosmological tracers.  
In this chapter we focus on LSST's potential to advance the astrophysics of
eruptive and explosive transients; the use of SNe for cosmology is
discussed in \autoref{chp:cosmo}.

Cadence choices will determine LSST's ability to discover, classify, and
characterize these events. However, different types and time scales of
phenomena will benefit from different sampling strategies---sometimes
significantly different, and at times orthogonal.  Competing objectives
described in this chapter are at the heart of LSST observing strategy and
cadence design.

When evaluating a particular observation or series of observations in
light of how they perform for a specific science case, it may be
helpful to think of metrics as lying along a continuum between
discovery and characterization. Discovery requires a minimum amount of
information to recognize an event or object as a candidate of
interest.  It is particulary relevant for science cases that require
triggering followup resources in real time from the live event stream.

Characterization, on the other hand, implies
that basic properties of the event may be determined from the
LSST observations, including but not limited to the classification of
the event. The level of characterization accessible through LSST data
will of course evolve with time for all the transients that have
characteristic time scales longer than a few days.

Characterization and classification of transient events 
benefits from substantial temporal sampling over the finite duration of the
event along with color information (perhaps contemporaneous). 
Transient events slower than $\sim$ weeks may be adequately sampled by
a uniform LSST cadence.  Obtaining adequate sampling for faster-evolving
events may require special scheduling
strategies.  For some event types, LSST can only be expected to
provide a discovery service, and followup will necessarily be
performed elsewhere so long as the cadence is sufficient to identify the
event type.
For some events, such as detecting electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave events,
serendipitous discoveries are unlikely, but
enabling a ToO program would provide the opportunity for LSST to
contribute significantly to this science.

%The interpretation of a given metric along this continuum has
%implications for the subsequent action and analysis required,
%particularly as regards possible follow-up observations with other
%facilities.

We consider a non-exhaustive set of ``astronomical transients'' in the

\subsection{Transient time scales}

For very short-lived phenomena (stellar flares, CV outbursts, GRBs),
the main function of LSST will be to provide discoveries
and/or simple characterization.  Followup to discovery/identification,
if required, must take place elsewhere. This implies that the LSST
observations must be sufficient to recognize that an event is fast-evolving
in real time in order to to trigger followup.

SN fall in an intermediate time range.  LSST will provide
multiple visits in multiple filters during the typical SN duration
(months).  This sampling may still be insufficient for many science
objectives, such as photometric classification of SN subtypes.  
However, moderate changes to LSST
observing strategy may enhance the sampling for part of the sky part
of the time, greatly improving the usefulness of SN observations. 
Metrics that assess the discovery rate of SN are included in the
cosmology chapter. Here we are interested in assessing the ability of
LSST to discriminate SN from other transients, SN subtypes from one
another, and to identify particularly interesting SNe: for example
those that show signature of shock break-out, or companion interaction
in the early light curve, and would be candidates for \emph{flash
spectroscopy} follow-up \citep[e.g.,][]{2014Natur.509..471G}. 
In addition, metrics that
quantify LSST's ability to constraint SN physics in a statistically
large sample of SN are needed.

TDEs have only recently started to be characterized in the optical bands. The current sample of events show relatively long time-scales(rise and decline of the light curve is over months). We would like to asses - through metrics - how well TDEs can be distinguished from supernovae based on their light curve shape and color (in real-time so that followup observations can be triggered) and how well the LSST light curves themselves can be used to model the TDE emission and deduce the black hole properties.
Ref. Science Book: 10.6.1, \citet{Gezari2012, Chornock2014, Arcavi2014, Holoien2014, Holoien2016, Holoien2016a}.

Large amplitude flares from AGN may mimic
explosive transients; they are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chp:agn}.

In addition we hope that LSST will provide a wealth of serendipitous
discoveries of yet-to-be-observed transients.  An ideal transient
discovery survey would include balanced coverage of all time scales. LSST
will cover longer time periods well, but will have to make some
choices of emphasis in coverage of shorter time-scales. 
\textbf{histograms of delta-t}

In the secitons that follow we will use case studies to asses:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The discerning power of a given LSST observing cadence.
  While early classification of transients is extremely important for
  transient science with LSST, it is also an incerdibly difficult task,
  on which many astronomers and statisticians are working. It is unfeasible,
  and beyond the scope of this work to attempt a naive classification metric.
  However a crucial input to follow-up strategy design is the early
  identification of young, fast evolving transients. We identify a region of
  the phase-space of rising speed and color that is characteristif of a
  variety of transients in their early phases and assess the ability of LSST's
  cadences to place transients within this phase-space. (Eric, Stefano, Iair, Fed...)
  %For this topic we will address the ability to distinguish LBVs, SNe, and TDEs.
\item
  The ability to identify in real-time a rapidly-evolving 
  object of interest and
  trigger prompt follow-up observations. For this topic GRBs are used as
  a case study. ***ERIC
\item
  The insight that a cadence gives into a single transient class. The
  case study will be
  **massive star eruptions if Nathan gets it done
  **CVs if Laura gets it done
\item 
  The statistical constraints to a transient class that can be obtained
  over the course of the LSST survey, from the LSST survey data alone
  (assuming a successful classification). SN Ia early interaction
  signatures or IIb shock break-out (Fed).
\item
  The ability of LSST, given a cadence, to provide insightful coverage
  for long duration transients. This metric favors cadences with small
  seasonal gaps, which allow us to gather complete color evolution of
  slow evolving transients, such as LBV and TDEs. (Ryan)

\citet{2015arXiv150803175L} discuss
three metrics that have been incorporated into the MAF. Two of these
metrics deal explicitly with time variable behavior: a) observational
triplets, and b) detection of periodic variability. While in this
chapter w do not deal with periodic phenomena, the first of these
metrics is useful to generically assess the performance of LSST for
transients of all types. More specialized transients metrics can be
obtained by simply using a more realistic light curve shape. A metric
that uses input ASCII files is provided, to enable the assessment of
discovery and characterization of an arbitrarily shaped transient.

\subsubsection{Observational triplets (TripletMetric)}

This metric provides a means of evaluating whether a transient event
on some time scale of interest has been detected, by testing for a
sequence of three observations. The object must be detected in
quiescence, followed by two subsequent detections above some
threshold; this sequence of observations allows the magnitude of the
change to be measured, as well as its time scale.

This metric may be used for a variety of astrophysical phenomena, in
particular transient events on variable objects (e.g. novae, stellar
flares), in that it is general with respect to the amplitude of the
brightness variation as well as the time scale of said change. The
requirement of a detection prior to outburst does constrain it to
objects that have already been detected in quiescence (in other words,
not necessarily ``true'' transients), although there may be some cases
where this is not the case (e.g. a supernova occurring on a previously
detected galaxy). In practice, the time lapse between the first and
second and second and third observations must be comparable (between
10$^2$ and 10$^5$ seconds) for discovery. This metric may be
calculated for a given OpSim run and then further reduced to a
histogram in logarithmic time bins; the minimum number of bins to
construct an interesting sample of objects is source-dependent.

\subsubsection{Transient Metric (transientAsciiMetric)}

Calculate what fraction of transients would be detected using an ASCII
input file for the light curve.

\subsection{Proposed Metrics}

The following is a raw list of metric ideas; these need specificity
and further description.

The triplet metric may also be altered to include filter constraints,
such that the triplets are drawn from a single filter or subset of
filters.

Color evolution constraint: triplets of observations in a specific
color (really requirement of two triplets in multiple filters)

  2D Histogram of delta ts between observations constituting a triplet

Histogram of median visit series length vs maximum visit spacing
within the series

Number of events adequately sampled

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\chpname:analysis}

Analysis shows that current simulations provide  poor coverage in any one filter for transient events longer than a deep drilling session ($\sim$30 minutes) and shorter than $\sim$ weeks.

Simulated performance for SN observations must be analyzed for both
main survey and mini-survey (deep drilling) productivity.  It is
considered that current simulated schedules give inadequate
performance for SN science.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\chpname:discussion}

Community studies are providing improving SNe metrics, and continuing
communication between the SN and LSST communities is essential to
tuning the observing strategy to deliver the SN time series that are
needed and possible.

Improving LSST science return for SNe will also improve sampling of
all transients with similar or somewhat shorter characteristic times.
Non-uniform survey strategies (rolling cadence) can significantly
improve the LSST performance for faster transients.  Interpretation of
multiple filters for novel events may be powerful, or problematic,
since color may be uncertain.

Some insight into fast transients may be available from image pairs or
triples (as opposed to more complete series).  These include the pair
of images in a visit - which could be useful in studying the rise time
of an extremely fast event.  This includes the characteristic grouping
of visits (typically 0.5 to 1.0 hour separation) planned for purposes
of identifying asteroids.  It also includes fortuitous multiple
sampling due to field overlap, providing additional sampling, which
may be random or systematic, depending on the scheduling, on a time
scale of minutes to hours.  The sampling benefits of this fortuitous
overlap have not yet been investigated.
